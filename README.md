# Tic-Tac-Toe Game
A simple, interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description
This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game where two players (X and O) take turns marking cells on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins the game. If all cells are filled without any player winning, the game ends in a draw.

## Features
- Player turn management: Players alternate turns to place 'X' or 'O' in the grid.
- Winner check: The game automatically checks for a winner after every move.
- Draw check: The game also checks if the game is a draw if all cells are filled with no winner.
- Restart button: The game can be reset with the "Restart" button for a new game.
